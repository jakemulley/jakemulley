# 👋, world

I'm currently working in the [Platforms and Architecture](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/) team at [Ministry of Justice](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice).

I was previously working at [Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government) and [UK Parliament](https://parliament.uk).

Some of my work is open source here on [GitHub](https://github.com/jakemulley), and you can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/carboia) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jakemulley).

😄 My pronouns are: `he`/`him`

⚡️ Fun fact: I've run/walked/completed 4 marathons
