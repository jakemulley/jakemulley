# ðŸ‘‹, world

I'm currently working in the [Digital Land](https://digital-land.github.io/) team at the [Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government).

Some of my work is open source here on [GitHub](https://github.com/jakemulley), and you can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/carboia) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jakemulley).

ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are: `he`/`him`

âš¡ Fun fact: I've run/walked/completed 4 marathons
